# LDA-for-Iris-dataset
SPEECH CLASSIFICATION
OBJECTIVE:
Implement LDA in IRIS dataset having 4 features to decrease the number of features to one/two. Now using this modified dataset, try to learn a classifier to test the performance of LDA for dimensionality reduction

LDA:
LDA is a classification method that operates by projecting a dataset onto a lower-dimensional space with good class-separability in order to avoid overfitting and to reduce computational costs. It has been widely used in the fields of pattern recognition, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
